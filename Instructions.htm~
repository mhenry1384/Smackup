		<p>This is intended for backing up to a second hard drive or over a network share. 
			This script runs under Windows, though it may work on other OSes as well.
		</p>
		<b>Advantages:</b><br>
		<p>* The main backup directory contains a mirror of the directories you backed up. 
			Previous revisions of files, or deleted files, are kept in the "archive" backup 
			subdirectory. This has the advantages of a mirror backup (easy to restore) and 
			a incremental backup (can get previously backed up versions of files).</p>
		<p>* Does not use the archive file attribute to determine what files need to be 
			backed up. This can be altered if you share/unshare a directory in Windows, and 
			in other situations, falsely indicating all files need to be backed up. Also, 
			if you rely on the archive attribute, files can only be backed up to one 
			location. Instead, Smackup uses a combination of the file size and file 
			modified datestamp to determine that a file has been altered. You can use 
			Smackup to, for example, back up your files to both a removeable hard drive and 
			a network share.</p>
		<p>* If a file is moved, it does not make another backup of the file. Instead the 
			file is also moved in the backup directory.</p>
		<p>* Does not use a .zip file or any other kind of monolithic file for the backup, 
			ensuring that there is no limit to the amount of data that can be backed up, 
			and no chance of losing all your data if one file gets corrupted.</p>
		<p>* No need to worry about full vs. differential vs. incremental backups vs. 
			mirroring. There is only one kind of backup, and it provides the best 
			attributes of all of them.</p>
		<p>* If you start running out of space, it's easy to clean up old backups, just 
			delete the oldest few Archive subdirectories.</p>
		<p>* No limit to the size of data you are backing up. Many other backup programs 
			choke around the 4 gig mark.</p>
		<p>* Written in Python and has no external dependencies other than the standard 
			Python install. Includes a Windows executable if you don't have Python 
			installed.</p>
		<b>Disadvantages:</b><br>
		<p>* Does not do any kind of compression. If you have a lot of media files however, 
			this is not much of a disadvantage as they do not compress anyway.</p>
		<p>* Does not do a "diff" of the files, meaning that if you have a large file that 
			changes slightly between backups, the entire file is backed up every time you 
			do a backup. Again, if you have a lot of media files, the amount of space they 
			take up will overwhelm saving a few bytes by storing individual file diffs.</p>
		<p>* Not designed to work efficiently over a wide area network or over the 
			Internet, though it will happily back up to a network share.</p>
		<p>* No GUI to configure what files you wish to backup. However, the config file is 
			a simple text file and a GUI could easily be added later.</p>

The Destination Tree looks like this
	&lt;Destination&gt;
		Current
			&lt;SourceName1&gt;
			&lt;SourceName2&gt;
			&lt;SourceName3&gt;
		Archive
			&lt;Date1&gt;
				&lt;SourceName1&gt;
				&lt;SourceName2&gt;
				&lt;SourceName3&gt;
			&lt;Date2&gt;
				&lt;SourceName1&gt;
				&lt;SourceName2&gt;
				&lt;SourceName3&gt;
</pre>
		<p>
			You can also have an exclusion list. Any source filespec that matches an entry 
			in the exclusion list will not be backed up. Examples of exclusions are "*.txt" 
			or "c:\Foo\*.tmp". Only * and ? wildcards are supported. If something is added 
			to the exlusion list that causes files to be excluded that were being backed 
			up, those files will be moved to the archive directory.</p>
		<p><b>Configuration:</b> See the sample Smackup.config file.</p>
		<p><b>Usage:</b> %USAGE%</p>
		<p><b>Running: </b>This script is written in Python. If you don't have Python 
			installed, there is a Windows executable in the dist directory. Run "Smackup
			<configfilename>" if you are using the windows exectuable or "Smackup.py <configfilename>" 
			to run the Python script.</p>
